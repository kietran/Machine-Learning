## Introduction

Instagram generates a lot of data every day. When content creators post on Instagram, they do look at their engagement and reach to find the category of posts they should post more.
The goal is:
  - Predict the reach of an Instagram post

## Data Source
This data set is taken from statso, the link to which is:

## Features

This is a very detailed and explanatory project for beginners who are looking to get their hands dirty with Exploratory Data Analysis, Hypothesis Testing, and Linear Regression.

- Exploratory Data Analysis of Numerical Variables.
- Using Z-score normalization.
- Using OLS and Cost Function.

## Learnings

The project I worked on, taught me several things:
- Getting comfortable with working with a relatively large and noisy dataset.
- Using and showcasing several Python techniques and libraries:
  1. Numpy
  2. Pandas
  3. Matplotlib
  4. Seaborn
  5. Scikit Learn
- Using techniques like:
  1. Identifying Input Features and Target Variables.
  2. Visualizing different graphs for different variables.
  3. Visualizing relationships amongst different variables.
- Hypothesis Testing:
  1. Deciding which test to conduct.
  2. Defining a significant alpha value.
- Employing OLS and Z-score normalization to build a Multiple Linear Regression Model
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing splits.
- Visualising the predictions and actual values via scatterplot.
- Using Regression Performance Metrics to check the accuracy of our model:
    1. Mean Absolute Error
    2. Mean Squared Error
    3. Root Mean Squared Error
    4. R2 Score
- Feature Scaling
  1. Using Z-Score Normalization to scale the input features for a better and more accurate model.
- Visualising the predictions and actual values via scatterplot.
- Using Regression Performance Metrics to check the accuracy of our model:
  1. Mean Absolute Error
  2. Mean Squared Error
  3. Root Mean Squared Error
  4. R2 Score
